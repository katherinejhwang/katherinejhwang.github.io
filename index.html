              <p> I am a California native, born and raised in the San Fernando Valley and attended UC Berkeley for undergrad, graduating in 2004 with a B.A. in American Studies (Minority Identity) and a minor in Peace and Conflict Studies (Human Rights). During college, I worked in the UC Berkeley computer labs, known as “Café,” where I met many of my lifelong friends.
              <br>
              <br>
              In 2006, I moved to New York to attend the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law, graduating in 2009, and practiced law for 9 years.  I have held positions in human rights organizations, private practice and government doing criminal and civil prosecution. I also have supervisory and management experience through my volunteer position with the New York County Lawyers Association.
              <br>
              <br>
              In 2018, I decided to move back to California, and attend the UCLA Extension Coding Bootcamp to learn how to code and get a job in the tech community.  I am looking forward to making new friends in the community.

              <br>
              When I am not working, I am usually doing something active, whether it be running, biking, swimming, hiking, pilates reformer or yoga.  I am also an avid traveller and nature lover, having travelled to 36 states and 26 countries.  In 2018, I drove across country and gained a great appreciation for our U.S. National Parks. I also recently traveled to Thailand and obtained my open water scuba diving certification in Koh Tao and am looking forward traveling around the world to dive and meet new friends.
