              <p> I am a California native, born and raised in the San Fernando Valley and attended UC Berkeley for undergrad, graduating in 2004 with a B.A. in American Studies (Minority Identity) and a minor in Peace and Conflict Studies (Human Rights). During college, I worked in the UC Berkeley computer labs, known as “Café,” where I met many of my lifelong friends.
              <br>
              <br>
              In 2006, I moved to New York to attend the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law, graduating in 2009, and practiced law for 9 years.  I held positions in human rights organizations, private practice, and government conducting criminal and civil investigations and prosecuting a variety of crimes. I also have supervisory and management experience through my position at the New York City Department of Investigation and through my volunteer position with the New York County Lawyers Association, where I started the Resume Review Program to assist young lawyers and lawyers in transition with their resume and careers, and served as a Co-Chair of the Young Lawyers Section (YLS), and was awarded the YLS Rising Star of NYCLA Award in 2016.
              <br>
              <br>
              In 2018, I move back to California to be closer to my parents, and decided to take time off from lawyering to attend the UCLA Extension Coding Bootcamp to learn how to code and get a job in the tech community either as a code or as a lawyer.  I am looking forward to making new friends in the community.
              <br>
              <br>
              When I am not working, but let's face it, I am a workaholic, I am usually doing something active and preferably outdoors, whether it be running, biking, swimming, hiking, pilates reformer or yoga.  I am also an avid traveler and nature lover, having traveled to 36 states and 26 countries.  In 2018, I drove across country and visited several of our great U.S. National Parks and was forever changed by the experience.  I gained a great appreciation for the vast diversity of topography our nation has to offer, was humbled by the magnificence that nature has to offer, and have great gratitude towards the stewards of our earth who seek to conserve our parks for future generations. I also recently backpacked through Thailand for about a month and obtained my open water scuba diving certification in the magical island of Koh Tao in the Gulf of Thailand and am looking forward traveling around the world to dive and meet new diving friends. I also love music, reading, photography, watching movies, and good conversation with great friends.
